# React.js Multi-Client Application

This project is a React.js application designed to serve multiple clients with the same codebase, but with different UI/behavior based on client-specific configurations. It leverages conditional rendering to customize the user experience for each client.

## Overview

In many scenarios, it's common to have a single codebase for a React.js application that serves multiple clients, such as different organizations, businesses, or user groups. However, each client may have specific requirements or branding that necessitates unique UI elements or functionality.

This project demonstrates how to manage multiple clients within a single React.js codebase by utilizing conditional rendering. By configuring client-specific settings, components can adapt their appearance and behavior accordingly, allowing for a tailored experience for each client without duplicating code.

## Features

- **Client-Specific Configuration**: Define client-specific settings or configurations to customize the application for each client.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Utilize conditional rendering techniques to display different UI elements or behaviors based on the current client.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Customize styles based on client preferences, such as colors, fonts, or layout.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build:client -- --client client2`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
